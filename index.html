    <h3 class="background"><u>Background Information.</u></h3>
    <p>
        My name is <em>Amos Kibet</em>. I am a 23 year old Kenyan citizen by birth.
        Being the firstbon, I had a big role in the way of being a leader and a servant
        to my siblings  both at the same time.
        Parents also expected alot from me, something that has helped me detect and execute my
        responsibilities without much supervision. <br> <br>I was born in a christian background and therefore
        I know a lot about the religion and am also a believer.

    <h3 class="academic"><u>Academic Information.</u></h3>
    <p>
      At the age of 5, as constantly the norm, I started my Academic journey. I joined
      <u><em>Sigor Boarding Primary School</em></u> where i learnt till class 7, that was 2007. In 2008 I transferred
     to <u>Imara Academy</u> whre I did my KCSE examination and score 377 marks out of the possible 500 marks.<br><br>
     In January 2009 I recieved an admission letter from my dream High School!.. That was <u>Tenwek High School</u>.
     I was a blast for me. When I joine Tenwek High School my interest in computers started immediately. This was the
     place where I interacted with the computer up-close and <span class="personal">personal and thats where my journey towards coding started.
     In high school my dream was to go to a university and persue  Bsc. Computer Science. However i did not see this come true
     since after the KCSE results were out, my Grade would not allow me to persue my dream course on a government
     sponsorship program. This broke my heart but i never gave up.<br><br> In January 2014 i was admitted to The university of
     Nairobi </span>. I had managed to secure a relatively noble course; BA Economics and Political Science. From
      the first semester however,
     I realized that it wasn't a thing I could be proud of. I decided to quit and look for something better to do.
     It took me 2 years to really settle my mind and I decided to take coding as a career.
    <br><br>
    To find a good school to learn how to code was a challenge..I did a lot of <em>online research.</em>
     <a href="http://moringaschool.com"><em>Moringa School</em></a> was the one with the best learning environment. Its a school that has earned
     respect and recognition within a short period. It also has a different learning system as I can say it moves withi
     the current market demands. Students also enjoy a teamwork environment where everyone counts.
